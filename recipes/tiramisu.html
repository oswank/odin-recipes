     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>This is an easy recipe I use for Tiramisu in my 8x8 inch dish. It is a rich, creamy and sweet coffee dessert that is made with ladyfingers (I use Lotus Biscoff cookies) soaked in espresso or strong coffee and rum, egg yolks, heavy cream, sugar, mascarpone, and unsweetened cocoa powder. It is my favorite dessert!</p>
     <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
     <p><i>For the cream:</i></p>
     <ul>
      <li>4 egg yolks (72 grams) </li>

     </ul>
     <p><i>For the assembly:</i></p>
     <ul>
       <li>1&frac34 espresso or strong coffee, I just use a dark roast <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Green-Mountain-Coffee-Single-Serve-Dark-Roast-Keurig-Coffee-Pods-60-Ct/50159021">k-cup</a> until I get an espresso machine</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons rum (Subsitute options: coffee liquor, amaretto or marsala wine)</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
       <li>20+ ladyfingers (Lotus Biscoff cookies) enough to fill the dish floor and second layer</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Steps:</h3>
     <ol>
       <li>Use an electric mixer in a big bowl to whip the 4 egg yolks and &frac14 cup (50 grams) sugar together until pale yellow and tripled in volume, a slight ribbon should fall from the whisk when lifted from the bowl.</li>
       <li>In another bowl, whip cream and &frac14 cup (50 grams) sugar (the rest of the sugar) until <a href="https://www.finecooking.com/article/whipping-to-soft-medium-and-firm-peaks">soft-medium peak</a>. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft and spreadable mixture with medium peaks.</li>
       <li>Gently combine both mixtures/bowls (the mascarpone mixture and the sweetened egg yolks).</li>
       <li>Use a sifter to dust the bottom of the 8x8 inch dish with 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder.</li>
       <li>Mix espresso/strong coffee and rum in a container that you can dip the cookies in, then one at a time quickly dip each cookie into the mixture and place them facing up at the bottom of the baking dish until fully and evenly covered (fill in gaps). Then spread half the mascarpone mixture ontop of the cookies in one even layer. Repeat for one more layer.</li>
       <li>Dust top layer with remaining cocoa powder.</li>
       <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refigerator for at least 4 hours, 24 hours is better.</li>
       <li>Enjoy!</li>
